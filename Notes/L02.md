Boeing 737 max accident was due to sensor related errors

# Connecting Cyber and Physical Worlds
$$sensor \to embedded\ processor \to actuators$$
Both sensors and actuators interact with physical world

# Automotives
1. Electronic control units: 100-200
1. Wired protocol
1. Monitors, diagostic components and wireless components may also be present on this wired network

## Functions (program size, # ECUs, bandwidth)
1. Powertrain - 2MB, 3-6 ECUs, 500Kb/s
    i. engine control
    i. transmission
    i. gear control
1. Chassis - 4.5MB, 6-10 ECUs, 500Kb/s
    i. antilock braking system
    i. electronic stability program
    i. automatic stability control
    i. adaptive cruise control
1. Body (comfort related) - 2.5MB, 14-30 ECUs, 100Kb/s
    i. AC/climate control
    i. dash board
    i. wipers, doors, sears, windows, mirrors
    i. cruise control
    i. parking distance control
1. Telematics - 100MB, 4-12 ECUs, 22Mb/s
    i. multimedia
    i. infotainment
    i. GPS
1. Passive safety - 1.5MB, 11-12 ECUs, 10Mb/s
    i. rollover sensors
    i. airbags
    i. belt pretensions

$$arduino\ board \equiv 1 ECU$$

## Engine Control
1. Tasks:
    i. calculate amount of fuel to inject
    i. decide time when injection should take place
1. Inputs:
    i. pedal
    i. load of engine
    i. temperature
1. Actuators:
    i. position of crankshaft
    i. valves
1. Relevance:
    i. avoid mechanical damage
    i. better performance

# Capabilities of ECUs
1. Clock frequency is usually less than 100MHz
1. Communicates less than 100 bits per packet
1. Stores less than 100MB of data

# Experiments on Arduino Board

## AES
1. Uses 9k bytes out of 32KB
1. Uses 1542k bytes out of 2KB for global variables

# P521
1. Doesn't compile on Arduino Uno due to memory constraints
1. After commenting the testing part, it takes 95% of code memory, 52% of variable memory
