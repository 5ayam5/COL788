Raspberry Pi 4B has an 8GB RAM :O

# Instruction Set
1. Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)
    - intel
    - single instruction used for loading, evaluating and storing operations
    - minimizes the number of instructions per program
    - increases the number of cycles per instruction
1. Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
    - ARM
    - basic instructions for loading, evaluating ans storing
    - increases the number of instructions
    - reduces the number of cycles per instruction

For embedded systems, RISC architecture is better:

1. Can't have a large ISA
1. Modularity
1. RISC utilises the processor more efficiently (compared to CISC which utilises the memory better)
1. Gives flexibility of order of instructions

# Processor
1. Scalar
    - simple implementation
    - slow
1. Superscalar (literally COL718)
    - supports parallel execution of instructions
    - multiple copies of functional units
    - $> 1$ instructions per cycle

# Memory
1. Resources that have addresses:
    i. DRAM
    i. Interrupt controllers
    i. I/O devices
1. Usage:
    i. processor generates a load/store
    i. address is decoded by memory address decoder
    i. routed to appropriate physical device
1. Address range:
    i. Main Memory Address Range: DRAM address
    i. MMIO Range

## MMIO Address Range
1. Fixed Address Memory Mapped Address:
    i. BIOS
    i. Timers
    i. Interrupt Controllers
1. Peripheral Component Interconnect Bus
