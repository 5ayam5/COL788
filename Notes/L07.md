# ARM Architecture
1. 32 bit ARM ISA
1. 16-bit Thumb ISA

# ARM Operating Modes
1. User
1. FIQ - high priority interrupt is raised
1. IRQ - low priority interrupt is raised
1. Supervisor - on reset and software interrupt
1. Abort - memory access violation
1. Undef - undefined instructions
1. System - priviledge mode using same registers as user mode

# ARM Register Set
1. $r_0 - r_{12}, r_{15}, oper$ is visible to all
1. $r_{13}, r_{14}$ are $sp$ and $lr$

# Exception Handling

## On Exception
1. ARM copies CPSR into SPSR_\<mode\>
1. Sets appropriate CPSR bits
    - change to ARM state
    - change to exception mode
    - disable interrupts
1. Sets the return address in LR_\<mode\>
1. Sets PC value to vector address

## On Return
1. Restores CPSR from SPSR_\<mode\>
1. Restores PC from LR_\<mode\>

# Program Status Registers

## Condition Code Flags
1. N = Negative result
1. Z = Zero result
1. C = Carried out
1. V = oVerflowed

## Interrupt Disable Bits
1. I = 1: disables IRQ
1. F = 1: disables FIQ

## Mode Bits
Specifies the processor mode

## T Bit
1. Architecture xT only
1. T = 0: ARM state
1. T = 1: Thumb state

# Program Counter
1. ARM state - all instructions are word aligned (and long)
1. Thumb state - all instructions are hald-word aligned (and long)
1. Jazelle state - all instructions are byte aligned (and long); 4 instructions are read at once

# Conditional Execution and Flags
1. Instructions can be made to execute conditionally, instead of adding jumps
1. ADDNE == ADD if not equal
1. Flags can be set by postfixing S: SUBS == SUB and set flag
1. Conditional codes exist which set approriate flags

# Data Instructions
1. Arithmetic: ADD, ADC, SUB, SBC, RSB, RSC
1. Logical: AND, ORR, EOR, BIC
1. Comparisons: CMP, TST, TEQ
1. Data movement: MOV, MVN
1. Only work on registers
