# Some More ARM Instructions
1. Compare and update flag but not register
1. Data movement instructions

# Barrel Shifter
1. ARM doesn't have actual shift instructions
1. $\exists$ barrel shifter which provides shifts as part of other instructions

## Left Shift
Multiply by $2^i$

## Logical Right Shift
Moves to the right and inserts 0's

## Arithmetic Right Shift
Division (preserves sign)

## Rotate Right
Bits wrap around

## Rotate Right Extended
C flag is used as $33^{rd}$ bit, rotates by 1 bit

## Using Barrel Shifter
1. Present between operand 2 and ALU
1. Can shift register value
1. Can encode immediate value easily
1. Delay depends on where the shift value is stored
    - immediate 5-bit field of instruction: no delay
    - bottom byte of register: 1 cycle (since ARM can't read 3 registers at once)
