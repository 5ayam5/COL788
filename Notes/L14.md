# Components Involved during Booting
1. Input supply
1. Power regulation
1. Field effect transistors - switches
1. Power sequencing and control
1. Board clock
1. SOC device
1. Expansion IO device

# Bootloader
1. Load kernel image into memory
1. Program system memory controllers
1. Initalize caches
1. Enable hardware devices

## BIOS-Based x86 Bootloader
1. BIOS from ROM
1. 512 bytes from raw storage
1. Kernel is loaded now

## GRUB - Grand Unified Bootloader
1. Very powerful, can read many fs formats to load kernel image and configuration
1. Also has a shell interface for custom options

## Booting on embedded CPUs - 1
1. No BIOS
1. On powering on, CPU starts executing code at fixed address
1. H/W design must ensure that a NOR flash chip is wired
1. First stage bootloader must be programmed at the fixed address in the NOR
1. Not widely used now

## Booting on embedded CPUs - 2
1. CPU has integrated boot code in ROM
1. Boot code is able to load first stage bootloader from storage device into SRAM

## U-Boot
1. Can define config file to make booting configuration easier
1. Can use for a large variety of embedded systems

### (some) Commands
These commands are available during the booting process

1. `help`
1. `fatload`
1. `ext2load`
1. `load`
1. `ls`
1. `size`
1. `ping`
1. `bootd`
