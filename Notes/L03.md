Won't cover initial few chapters from Seshia book (related to FSM design)

# Uploading Code to Arduino Board
1. AES takes about 25Kb/s (35 microseconds per byte)
1. If 16 bytes of data is to be sent, then about 0.5ms of overhead is observed
1. This is about 15% overhead total (encryption + decryption) for a powertrain ECU

# Design Characteristics
1. Interaction with physical world
1. Specific task
1. Real-time (safety-critical)
1. Large numbers
1. Low cost
1. Resource constraints

# Design Process
1. Highly optimised
    - interactions among different components
    - detailed implementation
1. Concurrency
    - timing
1. Correctness
    - modelling at high and low abstraction levels

## Example of Concurrency + Correctness
1. A drone was storing temperature and pressure value at the same memory location to reduce the memory consumption
1. Processor reads the wrong value - leads to drastic consequences

# Operating System (types)
1. No OS
1. Real-time operating system (RTOS)
1. Embedded linux distribution - we will use Raspberry Pi boards in this course

# CPU (types)
1. Atmel AVR Microcontroller
    - 8-bit
    - Arduino uno
1. MicroChip PIC microcontroller
    - 16-bit
1. ARM Cortex-M microcontroller
    - 32-bit
    - smart-watch etc
1. ARM Cortex-A microcontroller
    - 64-bit
    - Raspberry Pi 4

# System on Chip (SoC)
1. Different components are all integrated on a single chip
1. Has components like DRAM, processor, memory controller, etc
1. Nothing is going to change in the system (components cannot be modified) - helps in optimisations
1. Some more components are peripherals, interrupt controller, timers, power, clocks, boot flash

# Parallelism
1. Instruction level
    - instruction pipelining
    - superscalar execution
    - OOO execution
1. Data level
    - SIMD
1. Thread level
    - multithreading

# ISA
1. ARM
    - in-order cores
    - low power and lesser area
1. Intel Atom
    - in-order execution
    - data-level parallelism
